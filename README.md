# CDMCalculator
This is a program for calculating operations with Sets and Bool Algebra.
I created it by using python 3.9.7 language and its library for GUI PyQt5.
You will need to install PyQt5 library to use this application.
It contains of 3 widgets that have certain structure and cute design (as for me of course).
I created two algorythms those are based on Reverse Polish Notation and connected them to corresponding buttons.
